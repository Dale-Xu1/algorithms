# Algorithms Demonstration

## Overview

This is a visualized demonstration of various sorting, maze generation, and pathfinding algorithms. The maze generation algorithms include minimum spanning tree, uniform spanning tree, tree traversal, and specialized (for mazes) algorithms.

## Setup

Node.js is required to run the program.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
